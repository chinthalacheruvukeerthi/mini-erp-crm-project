# Mini ERP CRM System

## Project Overview

Mini ERP CRM System is a full-stack web application developed to simplify customer and product management for small and medium-sized businesses. The application provides a secure login system, an interactive dashboard, and separate modules to manage customers and products efficiently.

The project follows a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs, and all application data is stored in a MySQL database.

# Problem Statement

Many small businesses maintain customer and product information manually using spreadsheets or paper records. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.

The Mini ERP CRM System addresses these challenges by providing a centralized web application that allows users to securely manage customers and products through a simple interface.

# Objectives

- Develop a secure ERP CRM web application.
- Manage customer information efficiently.
- Manage product inventory.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Connect the application with a MySQL database.
- Provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
